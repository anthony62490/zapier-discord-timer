# zapier-discord-timer

to use: Get 2 webhook from discord server. One for the normal alert and the second for the 15 min warning
Set the 2 webhook constants with the id and token from each hook.
Set the "then" desired countdown time (converted to UTC)
If you are not in the US Central timezone, change the currentHour to make the proper adjustments

You'll need to configure the phrases and picture to your liking, but it should work as-is once the webhooks and "then" time are set.
